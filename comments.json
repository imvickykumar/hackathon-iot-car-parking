I cycled 4 kilometers . My intention was not to cover a lot of distance because this is my first time  after probably 2 years to cycle early in the morning . I cycled slowly .I was just enjoying the atmosphere and the scenery . The air was cool and fresh . Birds had  already started chirping at around 5 o&#39;clock . I watched the sunrise .It was beautiful . Evangalion is  one of the best anime ever made . You, random person I will never meet . I wish you success. Everything&#39;s gonna be okay . Have you ever thought that on our daily routine life like when we go to market etc. we see and meet people that we will never encounter again. They are there for a moment and then disappear forever . We should keep our expectations low and focus more on the work. I grew up  watching shows like Digimon,Pokemon , Kiteretsu, Ninja Hattori, Shin chan , Ben 10 , The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Mr bean , Power Rangers- S.P.D. , R.P.M. , Dino Thunder , Jungle Fury , Mystic Force , Ninja Storm , BeyBlade, Doraemon , Scooby Doo ,Powerpuff girls,Teen Titans ,My Gym Partner&#39;s a Monkey, Justice League , Inuyasha , Naruto , Eureka 7 , One Piece and many more. Then came the shows which I watched in my initial teens years randomly sometimes like Adventure Time, The Regular Show, We Bare Bears etc. If you have   seen a show named Tower of Druaga then tell me something about it , see , it exists as a hazy memory of mine  and I only remember its name. The days are long and hot and the air dry. Early morning tuitions in winters are I want to experience again but as more and more I age, everything&#39;s looks so much more inconsistent . Nothing is sure to happen. Mirrors by Justing Timberlake and its cover by Boyce Avenue is my favorite song. There are many songs I like eg. Apologize by One repiblic, dark Necessities and so many more that i won&#39;t be able to list here. There are two musical pieces   that I find myself listening to from time to time . First is &quot;Lit&quot; from A Silent Voice and the other is &quot;From Here To Eternity &quot; from Devilman Crybaby. I just read OPM&#39;s chapter 146 and Garou has arrived on the ground with a dope form. It still is not his awakened form yet. Oyasumi Punpun is one of the greatest pieces of art in the existence of this civilization. It resides in the upper echelons of manga with Berserk , Vagabond , AOT and many others . I want to talk about it but I am leaving it for some other day as this is a heavy manga and needs to be dealt carefully . I can write thousands of words long essays on it. I want to give it the time it deserves as an discussion topic . See I have noticed that most of the AMVs on Oyasumi Punpun were made during 2016.  Finding old songs is like finding an old friend. Le Festin from the OST of Ratatouille is a melody that I prefer to listen with your eyes closed and it suits in so many situations of life. It makes me forget the life around me and i find my soul mixing with it.  Once my head was bursting with pain and I couldn&#39;t think straight and forge coherent lines from my mouth in the trauma centre . There were sick people around me , some were in serious life threatening situations and so many worried family members . I started listening to Le Festin , it calmed my mind and suddenly the world which was seemingly moving with a speed of a bullet abruptly slowed down . But in the end I ran away from there. Coldplay&#39;s live performances are amazing . I remember once we were cleaning our classroom (we regularly cleaned our school and classes )and I dont remember why but  the prettiest girl of my class started singing Closer by The Chainsmokers and I joined her. I had never talked to her before. I used to admire her from the shadows you can say , as I was shy ,soft spoken and introverted . I never directly confronted her. I always liked her as a fellow better classmate . She was good in academics and extra curricular activities .She was a complete package being good at everything she did. She was tall and slim with a tiny head and a smile  as bright as the sun and large eyes . Something clicked in me at that moment when she sang and I joined her  , we both started singing looking eye to eye and smiling at each other. This was a cute little memory of mine. Eat good and stay hydrated . I will pray for you and your family&#39;s good health . I am here daily so if you feel alone then you can join me here. Now smile. Let&#39;s meet some other day.<br>Bye": [], "You came back but why?": [], "I cant unhear despacito 2": [], "\u062d\u0627\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0647\u0648\u0646\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\udde6\u0648 \u0645\u0628\u0631\u0648\u0643 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643 7.4 \u0645\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0629": [], "I just see an Indian song of 186 billion view song,then see this my mind blew up again\ud83d\ude00": [], "SIMPLY THE BEST!!": [], "Good job:))": [], "Guys this is the first time i hear this song Am i weird or something \ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude33": [], "The first person who watched this video must feel the king of the world": []}
